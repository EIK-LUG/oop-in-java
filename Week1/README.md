# oop-in-java

This repository contains some practice exercises to accompany the lectures.

First week:

You've been overloaded with too much new information, now try doing something and see if the pieces start falling into place.
The main focus on the first week is on very basic object oriented programming design not the implementation details yet.

If you want to practice the working details in addition to the PracticeSnippets then I suggest: [java introduction](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java/java-introduction)

For reference: [java quick guide](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_quick_guide.htm)

Note: No need to try to do them all :) 

### PractiseAbstract

Describing something abstract in nature. ex. A triangle:

* Some of it's properties
* It's structure
* What you can do with it
* What it can do
* etc.

Either improve the triangle class or write another class to describe something abstract.
ex. Other geometrical shapes, the weather, smell etc.

### PractiseDescriptive

Describe some image you choose. ex. A short comic.

* What do you see
* What is happening in the image
* What is the structure of the image like
* etc.

Either improve the existing code or write your own.
ex. Some comics: http://webdevrefinery.com/forums/topic/9459-funniest-programming-comics/

### PracticeProgrammatic

Design a program. ex. an expression tree calculator

* What does the program do
* What kind of data is stored during runtime
* What kind of components (classes) is it composed of

Either improve the existing code or write your own.
ex. A game (character classes, quests, items etc.)

### PracticeSnippets

Some actual working code writing, but only a little. You can find more on [java introduction](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java/java-introduction)
